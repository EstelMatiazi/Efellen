This is a rewrite of Secrets of Sosaria, focused on medieval fantasy and a general increase in difficulty. 

All artifact weapons have unique and interesting abilities, many enemies have been tweaked and made more dangerous, and the land itself is more hostile to adventurers that dare to brave it. 

It was build for experienced rnr/aoa/sos players, or to those brave enough to face it. Virtually every aspect of the game has been touched in some way, some systems have been retired, some have been altered for a more streamlined experience. It's a constant work in progress that aims to create a less bloated and more internaly consistent experience.
